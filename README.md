**JAMStack personal website.**

## Precondition
A desire to try JAMStack approach(no running server -> no free dyno hours), improve frontend skills and finally write a first blog post!
## Purpose
A place for my blogs, book reviews, and ideas I learned from them. I don't target a large audience, but it will be nice to know that someone may read it one day.
## Goal
A site with an attractive design. Where one or two times per month a new blog post or book review appears.
## Technologies
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - a site generator
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI library with a fantastic ecosystem
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - comes as a data retrieving approach with GatsbyJS
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - dynamics

The beauty of GatsbyJS is the approach. You are developing a usual web app with React and GraphQL, but under the hood,its a static site with all benefits. GatsbyJS is everything I like: React + GraphQL + fast development.
